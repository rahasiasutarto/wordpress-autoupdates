A feature plugin to integrate Plugins & Themes automatic updates in WordPress Core.

== Description ==

The purpose of this plugin is to prepare a future Plugins & Themes automatic updates feature.

**This is a Beta Test Plugin, you shouldnâ€™t use it in production.**

In 2018, Matt Mullenweg posted 9 projects for Core to focus on in 2019. We didnâ€™t ship as many as hoped, but we made a lot of progress. Plugins and Themes Automatic Updates were one of those 9 projects. This project is now milestoned to WordPress 5.5 and this feature plugin is here to help move towards this achievement.
